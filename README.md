# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

- after some issues with the installation a brand new project has been created and this one is working fine, since the configuration was done right.
- Sunday 14/08/2022 - finished at 35:09

- Working on project, this will be a main point of my new portfolio.. the goal is to finish the main version of this, and then elaborate on the basic version.

- Quite a lot of work done today, added the animated background for future reference: https://youtu.be/Tmkr2kKUEgU, finished at 55 minute: https://youtu.be/2kg0z1qNrkw

- finalising this tutorial, skipped some parts as they are not required.. react-scroll package seems to be interesting where this would do a smooth transition from anywhere on the site to the top and such.. at the same time found so called neumorphism - https://css-tricks.com/neumorphism-and-css/ & https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-neumorphism - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k48zirCrx8Q - https://neumorphism.io/#e0e0e0 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7WbVj5apxU glass design of Ui etc.. 



- THIS SHOULD BE NOW VERSION 1 CHANGE

* 2x components are now showing as they supposed to, however the drop down menu is not completed quite yet.. this will need to be changed, also button functionality https://react.school/ui/button 

- menu is now working fine, very small screen (below 640px) won't open social icons, this might be fixed later on, every major phone and tablet is working fine.

- ABOUT is partially done, content is JUST okay, will add more content, sizing is now correct. 
- Footer should be added and have a running text about courses, news, latest projects done.. otherwise this should be the portfolio, This should then continue with some other apps with some grids about projects.. 

- colour pallete is not set, not chosen.. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66416614/how-to-create-scrollable-element-in-tailwind-without-a-scrollbar could add this scroll bar hiding plugin, since the scroll bar is now visible, alternatively I could come up with a certain menu buttons to "load" different websites.. I would upload website to portfolio now to check how it is working, basically end of 23/08/2022

- https://www.smarterasp.net/support/kb/a2176/how-to-publish-a-react_js-project-to-your-hosting-account.aspx how to build the project and then upload to the server

- added GRID layout for skills, this could be great to add some technologies I have been working with, or at least use it a idea
- added the animation to the mix, seems to be lovely.. 

- going to follow a guide how to do a portfolio from here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-portfolio-website-react/ & the inspiration for the portfolio will be:

   For this I would create yet another branch, since this branch was successfull and the goal of this is now done.
